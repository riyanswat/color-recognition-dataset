# TL;DR 

This GitHub repository contains a dataset for color recognition, aimed at assisting color-blind people. It is organized by color, and contributions of high-quality images showcasing different shades and tones are requested to improve the dataset. By contributing, you help advance color recognition technology and create more inclusive tools for the color-blind.





# Color Recognition Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset for color recognition, specifically designed to train models that assist color-blind/color-agnosic people. The dataset is organized into directories based on common colors, with each directory containing images that feature the respective color.

To ensure the dataset's diversity and effectiveness, we kindly request your valuable contributions. We are particularly interested in obtaining high-quality images that showcase various shades and tones of colors. These additional contributions will significantly enhance the dataset and improve the development of models for color recognition.

If you have visually appealing images that predominantly represent specific colors or shades (e.g., shades of blue), we invite you to contribute them to this dataset. By adding your contributions, you will actively support the advancement of color recognition technology and help create more inclusive tools for color-blind/color-agnosic individuals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive collection of images representing various colors. As someone who has color agnosia myself, I was inspired to create this dataset to train models that assist people with color vision deficiencies in perceiving and identifying colors more effectively.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset follows a directory structure where each color has its own folder and images relevant to that color are placed inside. For example:
- blue/
  - blue_car.jpg
  - blue_shirt.png
  
- red/
  - red_dress.jpg
  - red_flower.png

- green/
  - green_grass.jpg
  - green_apple.png



Contributors are encouraged to add images to the appropriate color directories, ensuring that the images prominently feature the respective color. This will help create a diverse and representative dataset.

## Contributing

Contributions to this dataset are welcome! By contributing, you help advance color recognition technology and create more inclusive tools for the color-blind.
