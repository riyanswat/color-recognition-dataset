# Color Recognition Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for color recognition, specifically designed to train models that assist color-blind/color-agnosic people. The dataset is organized into directories based on common colors and each directory contains pictures that prominently feature the respective color. While I've scraped some data from DuckDuckGo using the duckduckgo_search module, I am in need of more high-quality images that prominently showcase the colors. I kindly request your contributions to help expand and improve this dataset. Your contributions will greatly benefit the development of models for color recognition. Thank you in advance for your support!


## Purpose

The purpose of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive collection of images representing various colors. As someone who has color agnosia myself, I was inspired to create this dataset to train models that assist people with color vision deficiencies in perceiving and identifying colors more effectively.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset follows a directory structure where each color has its own folder and images relevant to that color are placed inside. For example:
- blue/
  - blue_car.jpg
  - blue_shirt.png
  
- red/
  - red_dress.jpg
  - red_flower.png

- green/
  - green_grass.jpg
  - green_apple.png



Contributors are encouraged to add images to the appropriate color directories, ensuring that the images prominently feature the respective color. This will help create a diverse and representative dataset.

## Contributing

Contributions to this dataset are welcome! To contribute, please follow these guidelines:
